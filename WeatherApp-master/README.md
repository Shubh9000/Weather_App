## How It Works
1. **Enter a City Name:** The user inputs the name of the city they want to check the weather for.
2. **Fetch Weather Data:** The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve real-time weather information for the specified city.
3. **Display Results:** The weather details are shown on a clean, material-designed card. The background image automatically updates to match the weather conditions in the city.
